# âœ¨ CustomString
Hey, Darkuz_69 here!! This is my string implementation in C Language.

# ðŸ¤– Functions
In this library, strings are called "custom_string", which is an alias for the data type "char*"
~~~c
typedef char* custom_string;
~~~
Currently, this library has 4 Functions:
- ðŸ”¨ createString(string) -> a variable declaration function forr custom_strings
~~~c
custom_string myStr = createString("This is a sample string");
~~~
- ðŸ«´ getString(prompt) -> get a string from a user input
~~~c
custom_string myStr = getString("Enter something here: ");
~~~
- ðŸšš getLength(string) -> returns the length of the given string
~~~c
int len = getLength(myStr);
int len2 = getLength("Sample");
~~~
- ðŸ†“ freeStrings() -> frees all the strings created by the user;
~~~c
freeStrings();
~~~
ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer: Please, always call this function when using this library for I have not yet achieved the skill to create some header magic to automatically call this function. In order to call this function, use the atexit function...
~~~c
atexit(freeStrings);
~~~

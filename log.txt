    This is my second attempt on creating a string implementation on C Language. My last attempt cannot be accessed because it was on
    my old laptop, which was been damaged. So, I tried to do it again.
    Currently, I have 4 functions in this library: createString(), getString(), getLength(), and freeStrings();
    Also the strings or what I call here, a "custom_string", is just an alias for the type "char *".
    I have also created a readme file for this...
    📌 Planning to implement:
        More functions essential for strings
        Try to fix the "undefined reference" error
    📬 Pesronal Message to self:
        Maypag wa sa diay ta mi aris iskol. Pero okay ra atleast layo2x naning librariha. Yati, ayuha ning undefined reference, dugay rako galagot ana.
        Pero badshit kaajo.. HAHAHAHHAHA😂....

    This is my second attempt on creating a string implementation on C Language. My last attempt cannot be accessed because it was on
    my old laptop, which was been damaged. So, I tried to do it again.
    Currently, I have 4 functions in this library: createString(), getString(), getLength(), and freeStrings();
    Also the strings or what I call here, a "custom_string", is just an alias for the type "char *".
    I have also created a readme file for this...
    📌 Planning to implement:
        More functions essential for strings
        Try to fix the "undefined reference" error

    🔔 Updates:
        I have made a linker file for this library, so when compiling, one must use the "-lcustomstring" to link the library to my file.
        With the help of chatGPT, we were able to make the freeStrings() run automatically at the end of a program...
